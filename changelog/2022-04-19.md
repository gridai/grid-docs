### Datastore Enhancements

#### :star: Faster S3 Datastores!

We are happy to announce that, as of today, creating datastores from S3 buckets is almost instant!

In most cases, your S3 bucket will fit one (or both) of the following criteria:
1. the bucket is continually updating with new data which you want included in a Grid datastore 
2. the bucket is particularly large (leading to long datastore creation times)

In both of these cases, you can pass the `--no-copy` flag to the `grid datastore create` command. This flag will
prevent grid from making a copy of the dataset, which significantly speeds up datastore creation time when working with large buckets or ones that you want to continually update with new files.

Here's an example:
`grid datastore create S3://ruff-public-sample-data/esRedditJson --no-copy` 

:::note
Please note that direct access to private S3 buckets is not currently supported.
