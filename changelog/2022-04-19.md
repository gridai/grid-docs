### Datastore Enhancements

#### :star: Faster S3 Datastores!

We are happy to announce that, as of today, creating datastores from S3 buckets is almost instant!

In most cases, your S3 bucket will fit one (or both) of the following criteria:
1. the bucket is continually updating with new data which you want included in a Grid datastore 
2. the bucket is particularly large (leading to long datastore creation times)

In both of these cases, you can pass the `--no-copy` flag to the `grid datastore create` command. This flag will prevent Grid from making a copy of the dataset, which significantly speeds up datastore creation time when working with large buckets or when you intend to make incremental changes to your bucket and do not want to re-upload the entire dataset each time you add a new file.

Here's an example:
`grid datastore create S3://ruff-public-sample-data/esRedditJson --no-copy` 

:::note
Please note that direct access to private S3 buckets is not currently supported.
