**CLI version: 0.8.65 **

This release includes an important update to how CPU and memory are allocated to experiments.  

Prior to this release, Grid would set the default number of CPUs to 1 when creating runs and not explictly specifying `--cpus`.

We recently discovered an issue with runs where setting `--cpus` 1 would also reduce the memory, causing lots of OOM issues.

So we've updated this behavior to set `--cpus` to 0 by default. This applies when creating runs with GPUs as well. By setting `--cpus` to 0, the backend will allocate all available CPU and memory to the experiment.
