## New Datastores Features

### Private S3 Mounting  

Grid now supports the ability to create Datastores from private AWS S3 buckets by using
the `--no-copy` mode via the CLI. This is particularly valuable for incrementally adding data to the source bucket. Using this flag can also speed up datastore creation when working with large buckets. 

In order to allow Grid to access your private buckets,
you'll need to create an authorized AWS Role using the `grid credential create --type s3`
command (explained in detail below). After creating a role, you can run the
`grid datastore create S3://<private-bucket-name-here> --no-copy` command as usual - no
modifications needed.

### High-Performance Datastores

High Performance Datastores (HPDs) allow Bring Your Own Cloud customers who are looking to scale large datasets to optimize latency and significantly speed up data access. Currently, HPDs are backed by the FSx for Lustre service and offer more scalability and higher throughput than conventional Grid datastores backed by AWS S3. 

HPDs are most useful for very large datasets (>1TB) or when a dataset is going to be using by a large number of concurrent experiments or sessions.
