### New and Improved Artifacts!

Today, we release an update to Artifacts which greatly improves stability and UX in the following ways:

- Ensures syncing of artifacts for fast-running experiments
- Ensures all artifacts that are produced by experiments are copied by Grid
- When the experiment stops running, the instance will not shut down until all artifacts have been copied

:::note
Note: With this change, a portion of instance CPU and RAM will be dedicated to artifact syncing processes. For users with memory-intensive code, if your code generates artifacts of size >= 1GB, you may experience a decrease in performance. In these scenarios, we recommend using an instance with more CPU/RAM.
