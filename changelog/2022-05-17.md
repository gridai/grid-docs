**CLI version: 0.8.47** 

Today's release includes several bug fixes to improve the overall experience with Grid. 

### Fixes and Enhancements: 

- Faster experiment failing when errors are encountered during build or code execution

- Improves the Run-creation flow in the Web UI by fixing error messages reported due to insufficient repo acess or invalid repos

- Stability improvements to the UI and event reloading

- Fixes experience with the drop-down in the experiments table which allows you to add hyperparameter columns

- Allows support for nested requirements.txt files:
Ex: 
```# install all mandatory dependencies
-r ./base.txt

# install all extra dependencies for full package testing
-r ./extra.txt

# install all loggers for full package testing
-r ./loggers.txt

# extended list of dependencies for development and run lint and tests
-r ./test.txt

# install all extra dependencies for running examples
-r ./examples.txt
```
