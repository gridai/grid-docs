# VSCode with Sessions

## Step 0: Create and add the SSH Key

Create an ssh key from the computer you'd like to connect from (skip this step if you already have a key)

```yaml
# make the ssh key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# add the keys to grid
grid ssh-keys add lit_key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

## Step 1: launch the session

```bash
grid session create --name fun-bear-259
```

## Step 2: login to the interactive session

```bash
grid session ssh fun-bear-259
```

## Step 3: Install remote ssh extension

:::note
You can clone any Github repositories into a Session using the [HTTPS cloning method](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line) (SSH will not work).
