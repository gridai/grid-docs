# GitHub Integration
See [here](https://docs.grid.ai/platform/github-integration) for detailed steps on how to integrate GitHub with Grid.

# Github login

Interactive Sessions automatically login into Github for you. You can clone any repositories into a Session using the [HTTPS cloning method](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line) (SSH will not work).
