# Demystifying Datastores

## What are Datastores

Datastores are high-performance, low-latency, versioned, and scalable datasets.

## What files can be accepted
Datastores can be created from any file type

## Why use Datastores
Datastores are zero cost datasets backed by cloud storage. **Add additional content as to why this is better than local directory storage etc**.

### Capabilities
Datastores today have 3 main capabilities:
1. Can be created from private S3 buckets in both Grid Cloud and Bring Your Own Cloud environments
2. Attachable to Runs and Sessions
3. Creatable from your local machine, Sessions, or your Cluster

### Convention
#### Datastore paths

1. Stored at /datastore/[datastore name]/[version] on both Runs and Sessions
