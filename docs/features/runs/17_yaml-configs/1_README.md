# YAML configs

## Using Environment Variables

You can pass in environment variables to be used by your experiment by using the **`environment`** key. Pass any values and those values will be available in your experiment context. For example:

```yaml
compute:
  train:
    environment:
      MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE: "example"
```

The environment variable **`MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE`** will be injected into your experiment runtime.

## Specifying Requirement Files

Grid will automatically install dependencies into your project using either `pip` or `conda`. It does that automatically by finding files either named `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` in your project's root.

If your dependencies live elsewhere, you can specify their location using the `dependency_file_info` attribute in the Grid YAML config.

```yaml
compute:
  train:
    dependency_file_info:
      package_manager: pip
      path: ./requirements/requirements.txt # can have any name
```

## Full Example

In this example, we run a hyper parameter sweep that creates 2 experiments. That's the case because we are using `random_search` with the `trials` parameter set to 2, which will randomly sample 2 combinations of hyper parameters from the combinations generated by `learning_rate` and `gamma`.

```yaml
# Main compute configuration.
compute:

  # Add cloud configuration here.
  provider:
    cluster: XXXXXX           # Cluster ID

  # Training configuration.
  train:
    cpus: 1                       # Number of CPUs
    gpus: 0                       # Number of GPUs
    instance: t2.xlarge           # AWS instance type

    # Your environment variables
    environment:
      MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE: "example"

    # Dependency file specification
    dependency_file_info:
      package_manager: pip
      path: ./requirements/requirements.txt # can have any name
```
