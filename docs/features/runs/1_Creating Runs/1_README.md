# Grid Runs Overview

:::note
Grid Runs support the use of Private PyPi repositories. Please see the following [documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/private-python-packages.html) for various methods of pip installing from private sources. Additionally, Runs by default will check for the latest commit hash on your repo branch.
If you'd like to test code that hasn't been pushed to your repo please use the [--localdir option](https://docs.grid.ai/features/runs/private-repos#the---localdir-option).
