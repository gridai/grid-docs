# Advanced How to create Runs
Runs are highly customizable "serverless" compute. For advanced users we offer two additional methods for customizing Runs. The examples cover the following:
1. [Creating Runs with Dockerfiles](./2_creating-runs-with-dockerfile.md)
2. [Creating Runs with config.yaml](./3_creating-runs-from-config.md)
3. [Interruptible Machines](./4_interruptible-machines.md)
4. [Auto-resuming Runs](./5_auto-resume-experiments.md)

# Next Steps
After viewing all the examples we recommend checking out our [sharing runs](../../3_Collaboration/1_sharing-runs.md) page to learn how to share your Runs!
