# Advanced How to create Runs
Runs are highly customizable "serverless" compute. For advanced users we offer two additional methods for customizing Runs. The examples cover the following:
1. [Creating Runs with Dockerfiles](https://docs.grid.ai/features/runs/creating-adv-runs/creating-runs-with-dockerfiles)
2. [Creating Runs with config.yaml](https://docs.grid.ai/features/runs/creating-adv-runs/creating-runs-with-config.yaml)
3. [Interruptible Machines](https://docs.grid.ai/features/runs/creating-adv-runs/interruptible-machines)
4. [Auto-resuming Runs](https://docs.grid.ai/features/runs/creating-adv-runs/auto-resume-experiments)

# Next Steps
After viewing all the examples we recommend checking out our [sharing runs](https://docs.grid.ai/features/runs/collaboration/sharing-runs) page to learn how to share your Runs!
