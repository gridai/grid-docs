# Running Julia programs

[Julia](https://julialang.org) scripts and hyper parameter sweeps can be run in Grid easily using CLI or the web UI. Both CPU and GPU instances are supported with all necessary system drivers pre-installed and set up, so you can take advantage of multiprocessing and compute acceleration hardware with no additional configuration.

## **Step 0 Prepare script**

* Have the Julia script available on Github
* Make sure the Julia script is invocable via the command line. No changes to your code are required when running on Grid
* Julia scripts must be named with the suffix .jl
* If any dependencies are required, the git repo must contain a valid Project.toml file which has been generated by the Julia standard library pkg manager utility.
* Optionally, you can test by creating an Interactive Session in Grid and running your script there

## **Step 1 Run on Grid**

* Start the Grid platform at platform.grid.ai
* In the Web UI, choose “New Run”
* Copy and paste the Github script or select the entry file in the dropdown menu
* Select Julia from the “framework” drop down option
* Add any script arguments
  * If the script accepts command line arguments, you can submit a hyperparameter sweep in the same way you do for a python based run

## **Step 2 See results**

* Any text sent to stdout from the Julia program will be available in the Stdout log
* Any artifacts written in the main program directory are automatically preserved
* If you are able to view Tensorboard logs then metrics are available in the Web UI as well as any artifacts

Note: The first time you run a Julia file, it will take a bit longer; you can track progress in Build logs

## **Step 3: Bonus CLI Examples**

Script1: [https://github.com/rlizzo/julia_binder_test/blob/master/demo.jl](https://github.com/rlizzo/julia_binder_test/blob/master/demo.jl)

Script arguments: --num "\[10,100,1000,10000\]"

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlizzo/julia_binder_test
cd julia_binder_test
grid run --instance_type t2.medium \
--framework julia \
--use_spot \
--cpus 1 \
demo.jl \
--num "[10,100,1000,10000]"
```

Script2: [https://github.com/rlizzo/TuringCLIExample/blob/main/fit.jl](https://github.com/rlizzo/TuringCLIExample/blob/main/fit.jl)

Script arguments: --num_samples "\[10,100,1000,10000\]"

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlizzo/TuringCLIExample
cd TuringCLIExample
grid run --instance_type t2.medium \
--framework julia \
--use_spot \
--cpus 1 \
fit.jl \
--num_samples 100
```

### Notes and limitations:

* Please be aware that following environment variables pertinent to the julia runtime configuration are set automatically before the script is invoked.
  * JULIA_PROJECT="@." where the current working directory is the root of your cloned repository.
  * JULIA_NUM_THREADS where the value is set to the number of CPUs you dedicate to each experiment.

The two environment variables above are equivalent to invoking a julia script with the following configuration options:

julia --project=@. --threads auto &lt;YOUR JULIA SCRIPT NAME&gt;.jl

* At this time, we only support the latest release of the Julia language (v1.6.1) please ensure that 1.6.1 is compatible with the Julia version specified in the \[compat\] section of the repository's Project.toml.
