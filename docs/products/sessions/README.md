## Sessions

For prototyping/debugging/analyzing, sometimes you need a LIVE machine. We call these _Sessions_.

Session features:

* Mount multiple GPUs
* Auto-mount datastores
* Pre-installed JupyterLab
* SSH access
* Visual Studio Code access
* Pause the session to save work and pause expenses
* Resume where you left off

## **Start a Session**

The equivalent via the CLI command:

```bash
# session with 2 M60 GPUs
grid session create --instance_type 2_m60_8gb
```

## Delete a Session

The equivalent CLI command:

```text
grid session delete $SESSION_NAME
```

## Share Data Between Sessions
At this time the only supported way to share data between sessions is to mount the sessions locally and copy files to the local mounts. Establishing SSH connection to your sessions is a prerequisite to this. See these [steps](./how-to-ssh-into-a-session.md) to set up SSH connection with your sessions. **Be sure to logout of the interactive session before attempting the next step**. After that you can do the following to create your session mounts:

```
# Do for each session you wish to share data between
mkdir <dir for SessionA>
grid session mount <SessionA> <dir for SessionA>
mkdir <dir for SessionA>/shared_data

# to share data from a session to another session
cp -R <source> <destination>/shared_data
```
