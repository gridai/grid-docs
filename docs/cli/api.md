to be searched over for each option. If a set of values are passed, a sweep (grid-search
or random-search) will be performed, launching the desired number of experiments in
parallel - each with a unique set of input arguments.

The script runs on the specified instance type and Grid collects the generated
artifacts, metrics, and logs; making them available for you to view in real time

#### change-instance-type

Change the instance type of a session; this allows you to upgrade
or downgrade the compute capability of the session nodes while keeping
all of your work in progress untouched.

The session must be PAUSED in order for this command to succeed

Specifying --spot allows you to change the instance to an interuptable
spot instances (which come at a steap discount, but which can be
interrupted and shut down at any point in time depending on cloud
provider instance type demand).

specifying --on_demand changes the instance to an on-demand type,
which cannot be inturrupted but is more expensive.

#### create

VSCode, Jupyter-lab, or SSH interfaces.

Grid manages the installation of any/all core libraries, drivers, and interfaces
to the outside world. Sessions can be run on anything from a small 2 CPU core +
4GB memory instance to a monster machine with 96 CPU cores + 824 GB memory + eight
V100 GPUs + 40 GBPS network bandwidth (no, those values aren't typos!); or really
anything in between.

data (assuming the source of the data was not a grid datastore - datastore
data is not deleted).

Examples:
    # Mounts the home directory on the interactive node in dir data
    grid session mount bluberry-122 ./data

    # mounts ~/data directory on the interactive node to ./data
    grid session mount bluberry-122:~/data ./data

To unmount it:
  fusermount3 -u mountpoint   # Linux
  umount mountpoint           # OS X, FreeBSD
