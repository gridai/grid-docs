# Keeping track of costs

## Dashboard View

The dashboard page shows a graph of Runs and Sessions and associated costs. You can also see what is currently active.

:::note
All costs are estimates until Runs or Sessions are complete.
:::

Runs and Sessions pages also show the cost per experiment and cost of each session; the dashboard is the easiest way to see the costs.

## Low Balance Warning

If the balance goes below $10, Grid will warn you about "low balance remaining".

Zero balance will prompt a shut down of interactive sessions as well as active runs.
