# Github Integration

## Signed up with Github

If you signed up to Grid with Github, you'll already be logged into your Github account when an interactive Session starts.

## Signed up with Google

If you signed up to Grid with Google, you'll have to link a Github account under **Settings** &gt; **Integrations**.

## Access Private Github Repos

By default you can only access public Github repositories on Grid. To grant access to your private code navigate to Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Grant access. Make sure to grant access to any private repositories you intend to use before using Session

## About authorization

When you grant access to private repositories in Github, the organizations that you have granted private access to will appear in [https://github.com/settings/applications](https://github.com/settings/applications) . When you want to use a script from a private repository in Grid, make sure that the organization shows up in the Applications section of Github settings

Click on the Grid AI organization to see permissions.

Make sure that Organization access above shows that permissions are granted to the repositories you have(this example is showing xyz). If Organization access is not requested, you will not be able to use scripts from the private repositories.

## About private code

Grid does not save your code, look at it or compromise its privacy in any way.

When receiving support, you will not have to share any code to help debug. If you choose to share code, make sure you have the rights to and share non-critical parts of the code.

## Core Features

###  Grid Sessions Automatic GitHub Login
Interactive Sessions automatically login into Github for you. You can clone any repositories into a Session using the [HTTPS cloning method](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line) (SSH will not work).

### Grid Run localdir Option
Currently, Grid has a native Github integration to allow running code from public or private repositories. There is currently no support for integration with other code repository providers like BitBucket, Gitlab, etc. We provide the --localdir feature within Grid run to allow users to run scripts from an arbitrary local directory, regardless of where that code is hosted. The main benefit of this feature is for users that do not need to grant Grid access to their code repository accounts. Below is an example usage of the grid run --local dir option.

```
grid run --localdir run.py
```
