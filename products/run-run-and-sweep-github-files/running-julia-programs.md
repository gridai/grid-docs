# Running Julia programs

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) scripts and hyper parameter sweeps can be run in Grid easily using CLI or the web UI. Both CPU and GPU instances are supported with all necessary system drivers pre-installed and set up, so you can take advantage of multiprocessing and compute acceleration hardware with no additional configuration. 

### **Step 0 Prepare script**

* Have the Julia script available on Github
* Make sure the script is invocable via the command line. No changes to your code are required when running on Grid
* Julia scripts must be named with the suffix .jl
* If any dependencies are required, the git repo must contain a valid Project.toml file which has been generated by the Julia standard library pkg manager utility.
* Optionally, you can test by creating an Interactive Session in Grid and running your script there

### **Step 1 Run on Grid**

* Start the Grid platform at platform.grid.ai
* In the Web UI, choose “New Run”
* Copy and paste the Github script or select the entry file in the dropdown menu
* Select Julia from the “framework” drop down option
* Add any script arguments
  * If the script accepts command line arguments, you can submit a hyperparameter sweep in the same way you do for a python based run

### **Step 2 See results**

* Any text sent to stdout from the Julia program will be available in the Stdout log
* Any artifacts written in the main program directory are automatically preserved 
* If you are able to view Tensorboard logs then metrics are available in the Web UI as well as any artifacts

Note: The first time you run a Julia file, it will take a bit longer; you can track progress in Build logs

### **Step 3: Bonus CLI Examples**

Script1: [https://github.com/rlizzo/julia\_binder\_test/blob/master/demo.jl](https://github.com/rlizzo/julia_binder_test/blob/master/demo.jl) 

Script arguments: --num "\[10,100,1000,10000\]"

Script2: [https://github.com/rlizzo/TuringCLIExample/blob/main/fit.jl](https://github.com/rlizzo/TuringCLIExample/blob/main/fit.jl)

Script arguments: --num\_samples "\[10,100,1000,10000\]"

```bash
grid run \
--grid_name nifty-tanuki-650 \
--grid_strategy grid_search \
--grid_disk_size 200 \
--grid_max_nodes 10 \
--grid_instance_type t2.medium \
--grid_framework julia \
--grid_credential cc-4nd5b \
--grid_cpus 1 \
fit.jl \
--num_samples 100
```

#### Notes and limitations:

* Please be aware that following environment variables pertinent to the julia runtime configuration are set automatically before the script is invoked.
  * JULIA\_PROJECT="@." where the current working directory is the root of your cloned repository.
  * JULIA\_NUM\_THREADS where the value is set to the number of CPUs you dedicate to each experiment.

The two environment variables above are equivalent to invoking a julia script with the following configuration options:

julia --project=@. --threads auto &lt;YOUR JULIA SCRIPT NAME&gt;.jl

* At this time, we only support the latest release of the Julia language \(v1.6.1\) please ensure that 1.6.1 is compatible with the Julia version specified in the \[compat\] section of the repository's Project.toml.
