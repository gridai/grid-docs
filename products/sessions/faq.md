# FAQ
## Why can't I push to my remote repository?
If you're having trouble pushing to the repo the recommended solution is to clone the repo via https and try pushing again. 

## "I can't access my private Github repository"
If you're having trouble with access to private Github repos, try the following:&#x20;

*   If you're logged into Grid with Google and have not linked a Github account already, **then link your Github account to Grid in the Grid UI in Settings** > **Integrations.**

    ****
* If you've already linked your Github account to Grid, but have not granted private repo access to Grid, then **** [**grant private repo access to Github in your Grid Settings.**](https://docs.grid.ai/products/sessions/github-login#access-private-github-repos)****
  *   Make sure to **log out and log back in after granting access.**

      ****
*   If you're having trouble accessing an organization repo, then make sure to also **grant organization access when granting private repo access in the Grid settings.**
